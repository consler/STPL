# This repository is no longer developed

## Reasoning
> You need JRE

> Too slow

> Bad structure to continue developing

> Slow intepretation

## I am sorry
Probably no-one's even gonna notice but I shouldn't have started this project in the first place, java is not a good language to develop a language on. Most people wouldn't want to install another language's virtual machine to run this one.
# Not all hope is lost
> I might remake the entire language that actually uses bytecode for intepretaion and make an IDE for Android.

> I might make something that's a more readable version of Brain***k that can be translated to it. It probably is going to be inspired by STPL, not sure though.

> I might try to do something that will fix all of its problems, but that's really unlikely.
